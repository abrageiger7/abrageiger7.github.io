               <section>
                  <p>My name is Abra Geiger, and I am a second-year student of physics and math at Cornell University. I am passionate about logical analyzation of the universe, intelligent conversation, outreach, and collaboration.</p>
                  <p>What I Do:</p>
                  <p>I work as a research assistant in the Cordes Radio Astronomy Group here at Cornell.</p>
                  <p>I am an undergraduate TA in the Cornell Physics Department for the honors introductory mechanics class, PHYS 1116.</p>
                  <p>I am the Women in Physics chair for the Cornell Chapter of the Society of Physics Students.</p>
                  <p>Who I Am:</p>
                  <p>I was born and raised in Rochester, NY.</p>
                  <p>I love to dance and practice yoga. I am most often found sitting in the grass (that is for the few months of warm weather we have in upstate NY.)</p>
                  <p>I am vegeterian and somewhat of a health guru. Maybe one day I will go back to veganism.</p>
                  <p>I enjoy a good read - usually the classics.</p>
