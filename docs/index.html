               <section>
                  <p>My name is Abra Geiger, and I am a second-year student of physics and math at Cornell University. I am passionate about logical analyzation of the universe, intelligent conversation, outreach, and collaboration. <a href="cv_aug_2023.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:black;" ><strong>My CV</strong></a> </p>
                  <p><strong>What I Do:</strong></p>
                  <p> - Research assistant in the Cordes Radio Astronomy Group here at Cornell.</p>
                  <p> - Undergraduate TA in the Cornell Physics Department for the honors introductory mechanics class, PHYS 1116.</p>
                  <p> - Women in Physics chair for the Cornell Chapter of the Society of Physics Students, Outreach Co-Director for The Steminist Movement | Cornell, Keyholder for Cornell Astronomical Society, and Treasurer and Ballet Teacher for Ballet&Books Ithaca.</p>
                  <p><strong>Who I Am:</strong></p>
                  <p> - I was born and raised in Rochester, NY.</p>
                  <p> - I love to dance and practice yoga. You can often find me sitting in the grass (that is for the few months of warm weather we have in upstate NY.)</p>
                  <p> - I am vegeterian and somewhat of a health guru. Maybe one day I will go back to veganism.</p>
                  <p> - I enjoy a good read - even if I am a slow reader (got to enjoy it!).</p>
                  <p> - I am so priviledged to be studying at Cornell - I love it here! <p>
